<u>Project Description:</u>

The objective of this project is to leverage historical stock data from Yahoo Financial and employ machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices. By comparing the performance of various models, including LSTM neural network, linear regression, random forest, and ARIMA - we aim to validate our thesis that a neural network model would yield superior accuracy in predicting stock prices. Through the analysis of key metrics and comparison of our predicted prices vs. actual closing prices, our goal is to identify the model that consistently provides the most accurate stock price forecasts, providing valuable insights for investors and traders in the financial market.


<u>Thesis:</u>  

* We hypothesized that the neural network model would yield superior accuracy in predicting stock price and would outperform the other models due to its ability to capture complex patterns and nonlinear relationships in the data.

<u>Approach:</u> 

* Using the Yahoo Finance library, we retrieved historical stock data on Goldman Sachs (Ticker: GS).
* We created and compared the performance of 6 different models, including linear regression, random forest, and ARIMA, and LSTM neural network to validate our thesis.
* Each model was assessed based on their ability to accurately forecast stock prices using historical data.
* By comparing the predictions generated by different models, we aimed to identify the model that consistently provided the most accurate stock price forecasts.


<u>Key Metrics:</u> 

* We evaluated the models based on metrics such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) to quantify the prediction accuracy.
